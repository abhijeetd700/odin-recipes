    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them until they are soft, fluffy,
        and slightly creamy. They are quick and easy to make, and you can customize them with various ingredients and
        seasonings to suit your taste.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: 4 large eggs</li>
        <li>Milk or cream: 2 tablespoons (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt: 1/4 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Black pepper: 1/8 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Butter or cooking oil: 1 tablespoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them until the yolks and whites are well combined.</li>
        <li>If using, add the milk or cream to the eggs and whisk until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add salt and black pepper to the egg mixture and whisk again to combine.</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-low heat and add the butter or cooking oil. Allow it to
            melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
        <li>If using any optional add-ins, saut√© them in the pan for a few minutes until they are tender (except for
            pre-cooked ingredients like ham or bacon).</li>
        <li>Pour the whisked egg mixture into the pan and let it sit for a few seconds until the edges start to set.
        </li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently stir and scramble the eggs by pushing them from the edges towards the center of the
            pan.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring and scrambling the eggs until they are cooked to your desired consistency. For soft and
            creamy scrambled eggs, cook them until they are just set but still slightly runny.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate immediately to prevent overcooking.</li>
        <li>Garnish with any additional toppings, such as fresh herbs or shredded cheese, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the scrambled eggs hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
