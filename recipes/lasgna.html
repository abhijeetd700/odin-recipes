    <h4>Steps:</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
          <li>Cook the lasagna noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
          <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
          <li>Cook the ground meat: Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Break up the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon or spatula as it cooks.</li>
          <li>Add the tomato sauce and tomatoes: Pour in the tomato sauce, canned diced tomatoes, and tomato paste into the skillet. Stir well to combine. Season with salt, pepper, dried oregano, and dried basil. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Prepare the cheese filling: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with a portion of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and evenly combined.</li>
          <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering process, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
          <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
          <li>Let it rest and serve: Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil. Slice and serve the lasagna while it's still warm.</li>
