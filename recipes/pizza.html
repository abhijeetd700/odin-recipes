    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature for baking pizza (typically around 475°F
            or 245°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.
            Transfer it to a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around
            the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Add cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese or a cheese blend over the sauce,
            ensuring even coverage.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Arrange your desired toppings over the cheese, distributing them evenly across the pizza.</li>
        <li>Seasoning (optional): If desired, sprinkle additional seasonings like dried oregano, dried basil, crushed
            red pepper flakes, or garlic powder over the toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake according to the dough package instructions
            or until the crust turns golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven: Once baked, carefully remove the pizza from the oven using oven mitts or a pizza peel.
            Allow it to cool slightly before slicing.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve: Cut the pizza into slices using a pizza cutter or sharp knife. Serve hot and enjoy your
            homemade pizza!</li>
